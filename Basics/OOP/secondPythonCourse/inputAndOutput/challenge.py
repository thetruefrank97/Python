# Write a program to append the times tables to our jabberwocky poem
# in sample.txt. We want the tables from 2 to 12 (similar to the output
# from the For loops part 2 lecture in section 6).
#
# The first column of numbers should be right justified. As an example, the 2 times table should look like this:
#    1 times 2 is 2


with open("sample.txt", "a") as tables:
    for i in range(2, 13):
        for j in range(1, 13):
            print("{1:>2} times {0} is {2}".format(i, j, i * j), file=tables)
        print("-" * 20, file=tables)
